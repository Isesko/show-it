## Idea
The idea for this project was to share important information along with nice little messages on various 
screens in the office in an engaging manner.

>Features we wanted for this app is as following:
> - The possibility of showing off videos/images/text.
> - The possibility of editing how long the different "posts" are shown.
> - The videos/images/text has a "valid until" period where they will be archived.
> - The possibility for an administrator user to edit the posts.



## Sketch
Here is the first sketch for this product.
![Sketch](/docs/image/sketch_Show-IT.png)
The sketch was drawn in Procreate on an ipad.
<br>
The home page here was more like a Navbar, as it was unsure what we wanted to have on the home page.
New post going to the creating page, edit going to show what posts this account has, and to an editing
page, which would be the same as creating just with the saved information on. See all would give an overview
over all posts in rotation at the current moment. 
<br>
For administrators they would get a popup that "'User' has suggested a post. [view]" where they could either
approve/deny or edit the post. However even when the post has been published and in rotation, they can still
be edited by the admin in the "Manage all" page where it would also show an overview over what monitor locations
had what posted at that moment. 



## Mockups
![Mockup_All](/docs/image/mockup_all.png)
The mockups were drawn in ClipStudio Paint.
<br>

#### The different parts in the mockups are:
- Logo
- Navigation bar
- Home
- Create new
- Overview

These mockups were the guidelines we had for the application. Using these as a guide to how the app itself was
going to be laid out and made. The design itself is pretty simplistic as the main focus is the company's content,
using few colors.

### Logo 
![Logo](/Logo_Show-IT_green.png)
The logo was created in ClipStudio Paint using vector layers.
<br>
The logo and name of the product is a pun itself, meaning both "show it" as in showing something and "IT" as it
is an IT tool. 

---


### Navigation bar
![Mockup_NavBar](/docs/image/mockup_navbar.png)
The navigation bar is pretty simple with the logo and user on each their side of the screen, with "home", "create new"
and "overview" equally spaced between them.

#### NavBar pages:
> - Logo
<br>
The logo itself works as the home button, sending you to the home page

> - Home
<br>
Sends you to the home page.

> - Create new
<br>
Sends you to the page to create new posts or edit your old ones, only if you are logged in.

>- Overview
<br>
Sends you to an overview page, highlighting the screens in the different areas and what they show, Underneath you
can see the different posts in rotation.

> - User
<br>
Sends you to log in and have your personal settings and information.

---


### Home Page
![Mockup_Home](/docs/image/mockup_home.png)
The home page will explain what this app is and what it does for the user, alongside a slideshow with this company's
posts or information and important things the company want to highlight.

#### Administrator access
On the home page an administrator will be able to edit what is being highlighted in the preview box. Wether it be 
company information or the same posts that are in rotation on some of the screens.

---


### Create New Page
![Mockup_Create](/docs/image/mockup_create.png)
Is an editor page that shows templates of different kinds. Sort of like "power point" editor. You can choose the template that fits your needs and insert what you want. These will be up to the company to create a standard. The text size and font will be automatic as to not create wildly different posts, and include a company logo.
<br>
It would also be a hub for your own created posts, where you can edit them.

---


### Overview Page
![Mockup_Overview](/docs/image/mockup_overview.png)
Here you will find an overview of the office's screen locations and what they show at this current moment as well as an
overview over the posts currently in rotation.

#### Administrator access
Here the administrators will have access to edit the posts and adjust the time they are up for as well as what will
be shown on the spesific screen locations. Only the Administrators will have access to these settings.
